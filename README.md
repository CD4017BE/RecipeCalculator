Recipe Calculator is a command-line application for calculating production chains in various factory building games (like for example Factorio, Satisfactory or automation oriented Minecraft modpacks).

The program takes a text-file as input that contains the list of available crafting recipes and the list of items that should be produced. It then recursively calculates how much of each recipe is required as well as a list of all needed raw materials that could not be crafted. The output is either written to the console or into another text-file that you can specify.

# Usage

Type `java -jar RecipeCalculator.jar` into a terminal with the current directory containing the program. It should then print out info about its usage.
